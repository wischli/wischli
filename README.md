### Hello friend 🤖

* 🔭	Currently, I am working on the node and protocol level of [Centrifuge](https://centrifuge.io/), the L1 for **R**eal **W**orld **A**ssets.
* 🧙‍	 Rust and Substrate get me the most excited, I hope to someday call myself a true wizard in these.
* 😍	Apart from that, I love open source projects in the Web3 environment.
* 🌱	I cherish to spend my freetime in the outdoors by taking long strolls through woods, hiking, cycling or snowboarding.
* 🎲	Board games are another passion of mine. My goal is to have played through the BGG Top 100 list before I hit the 40. Depending on the group, my favorite games are On Mars, Tera Mystica, Tigris & Euphrates, Dvonn, Spirit Island, Patchwork, Wingspan and last but not least Twilight Imperium.
