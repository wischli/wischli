### Hello friend 🤖

* 🔭  Currently, I am working on the node and protocol level of [KILTProtocol](https://www.kilt.io/) which gives users control over their data.
* 🧙‍ Rust and Substrate get me the most excited, I hope to someday become a wizard in these.
* 😍  Apart from that, I love open source projects in the Web3 environment.
* 🌱  I cherish to spend my freetime in the outdoors by taking long strolls through woods, hiking, cycling or snowboarding.
* 🎲. I also enjoy to play board games, my goal is to have played through the BGG Top 100 list before I hit the 40. Depending on the group, my favorite games are Gloomhaven (obviously), Tera Mystica, Spirit Island, Wingspan and last but not least Twilight Imperium.
